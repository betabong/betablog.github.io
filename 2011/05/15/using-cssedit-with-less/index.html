<h1 class='post-title'>Using CSSEdit with LESS</h1>
<section class='post-content'><p><img src="/uploads/2011/05/cssedit-less.jpg" /> <a href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSSEdit</a> is a great app I can&rsquo;t live (or at least work) without. I&rsquo;ve recently discovered the <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> language, which basically extends CSS with some very very useful functionality - mainly variables and something like functions (called mixins). (By the way, things Google is gonna support natively in their Chrome browser soon – using a slightly different syntax though. See <a href="http://goo.gl/gTWLt">here</a>) Although CSSEdit hasn&rsquo;t been updated for much too long, it&rsquo;s IMHO still the best CSS editor out there (I&rsquo;ve tried quite a few), and as much as I appreciate the bonus of LESS, I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna miss the comfort of CSSEdit. My first approach to using LESS files with CSSEdit goes like this: </p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" href="css/styles.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="js/dev/less.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>styles.css is actually a LESS file and just named with the extension .css so CSSEdit will force an update of its Live Preview every time you modify it. This works well with smaller html/css combos, but gets more difficult with every complexity level. Reason why is that the whole page will be refreshed with every change. (I&rsquo;ve tried to actually get around this by messing with the source less.js. Although I&rsquo;ve nailed the refresh triggering down to the xhr.send() the actual reason stayed mysterious to my brain cells. May be if I&rsquo;d knew the exact mechanism of how the CSSEdit Live Preview update works&hellip; but then, just read on:) <strong>There is though a fantastic solution.</strong> One that&rsquo;s also of big help if you work with other editors by the way. LESS has a very nice watch option. Whenever a linked LESS file gets updated, the resulting CSS will be generated and replaced. The great thing if you work with CSSEdit is that you won&rsquo;t have to save your file to see any changes. From a CSS designer (or developer) point of view the outcome is a near-instant live preview. (LESS actually checks for changes in a Timer interval of 1000ms). That&rsquo;s how this looks in code: </p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" href="css/styles.less"&gt;
&lt;script src="js/dev/less.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;less.watch();&lt;/script&gt;    
</code></pre>

<p>If you like to sometimes see a live preview and sometimes just css the hell out of you without any disturbances until the next save, you can also use the glorious Hash Override: just leave away the &ldquo;less.watch()&rdquo; part in your script and open your html in the live preview with an additional &ldquo;#!watch&rdquo; hash. Something like this: <img src="/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-15-at-15.29.33.png" /> Wow, this will easen my life (ehm.. work) so much! Seriously, I really started to hate those page reloads. Oh, and by the way, just in case I haven&rsquo;t noted so far: I&rsquo;d really love to see a CSSEdit update anytime soon. I&rsquo;m so much willing to drink my self made <a href="http://www.kochbuchfotos.de/14/espresso">Espresso</a> for that. ;-) In case the <a href="http://macrabbit.com/">Rabbit</a> listens.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p><strong><a title="2011-08-24 09:08:12" href="#358">Stu</a>:</strong> I am assuming this is all based on a local dev site and not a remote Dev site yes ? Trying to implement it using CSSEdits &ldquo;override&rdquo; option breaks all LESS tags, not surprisingly?</p>

<p><strong><a title="2011-08-31 21:06:32" href="#361">Philipp</a>:</strong> I found this post more or less by coincidence, then I got really really excited, when I got, that you are saying, that it is possible to use LESS with CSSEdit with its Live Preview. Now I tried it in Espresso, and it actually works easier than you are promising here. It just needs the LESS File as .css and the less.js - maybe the watch part is now activated by default. From now on i will learn and use LESS, thank you very much. Cheers, Phil</p>

<p><strong><a title="2011-12-12 03:29:22" href="#530">Rob</a>:</strong> Nice one, I&rsquo;ve been trying to @import media queries, which LESS.js can&rsquo;t seem to handle at the moment. I tried out both the links, auto<em>update</em>stylesheet was being too slow for practical use, css<em>auto</em>reload&rsquo;s bookmark is brilliant, but can&rsquo;t seem to get the js file version to work. A shame as I&rsquo;d like to use Espresso&rsquo;s browser with one of these. So for now at least, using Espresso, Chrome and Codekit (LESS.app&rsquo;s big brother) with the auto-reload bookmark might just be the way forward! Seems more software than should be needed, but hopefully that will change.</p>

<p><strong><a title="2011-09-14 10:10:42" href="#369">betabong</a>:</strong> The setup I&rsquo;ve described here seems to only work with Safari. Chrome won&rsquo;t permit loading of scripts other than from http, so also not from file://. You can get around that limitation by running the page inside your local webserver (http://localhost) My current approach is not too use the LESS javascript inside the page, but instead use LESS.app to watch the less files and convert them on save to CSS. Then I may use something like http://nv.github.com/css<em>auto-reload/ or https://github.com/adamlogic/auto</em>update_stylesheets This uses less computing power on the client side and seems to be the cleaner approach to me.</p>

<p><strong><a title="2011-05-31 19:40:32" href="#279">Rob</a>:</strong> I&rsquo;m a newcomer to LESS so only just discovering it&rsquo;s benefits — early indications are looking good. For some reason I hadn&rsquo;t thought of using it like this, I was more worried about getting the <a href="http://forrst.com/posts/Making_Espresso_syntax_highlight_SASS_SCSS-gxI">syntax working</a> on Espresso, as far as I can tell, there&rsquo;s no way of doing that on CSS Edit. So until MacRabbit pull their finger out, I&rsquo;ll have to put up with Espresso&rsquo;s limited grouping and CSS functionality. Thankfully this works on Espresso too, really helped me out — the #!Watch feature is brilliant!</p>

<p><strong><a title="2011-09-14 09:56:07" href="#368">Lukree</a>:</strong> Unfortunately I simply cannot get your approach to work&hellip; Only way I get some results is to use less.app to watch changes and generate actual css file and include that file in html header. This way I can use CSSEdit inspector to select elements.</p>

<p><strong><a title="2011-12-12 14:22:37" href="#531">betabong</a>:</strong> There&rsquo;s currently so much development going on that the words I write right now might be outdated tomorrow. Anyway, my setup quite changed since then: I got used to not have an instant preview, but still want to see changes I make whenever I save the file. Today I use LiveReload http://livereload.com/ to do that. It comes with a nice Chrome/Safari/FF plugin that reloads any kind of source on change. (and of course compiles all kind of coffee and less). CodeKit seems promising, but right now I don&rsquo;t like it too much for its lack of collaboration. I might look into it, because I might just have missed its abilities to handle with subversion, git and co. In the end I still have the feeling that there will be much better tools to come, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to improving my production and emotional computer time :-)</p>

<p><strong><a title="2012-02-17 00:44:32" href="#705">Jay</a>:</strong> Has anyone been able to get this working with Espresso and WordPress? I&rsquo;m dying to use LESS but not willing to give up the instant preview. I can get this to work on a static installation, but not WordPress - http://f.cl.ly/items/0y2G351r3O3T3j1b401u/Live-LESS-previewing-in-Espresso.html</p>
